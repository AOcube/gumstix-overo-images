## Build the Gumstix Overo Yocto Image
Choose one of the three methods below to build your base image for the Gumstix Overo board.

1. [Manual Build](build_manually.md) - This method is the most advanced and takes the longest but it allows for the most image customization.
2. [Scripted Build](build_scripted.md) - This method wraps all of the steps of the manual build into a script which allows for a faster build process.  Customizations can be made to the base image by editing the build script.
3. [Precompiled Image Build](build_precompiled_image.md) - This method is by far the fastest and easiest.  Simply download a prebuilt image which can then be installed to an SD card.

## Install your Yocto Image
* [Install Image to SD Card](install_image.md) - Once you have your image from one of the above build methods, this documentation will explain how to prepare an SD card for the Gumstix Overo board.
